                eye to the mentally challenged. Those who are mentally challenged 
                are often forgotten, stripped from their rights and treated as a
                burden to the community. We view a future where they are given 
                equal opportunities just like anyone else, not treated differently 
                than us and given facilities by the community. Any step towards 
                helping the mentally challenged aims towards a better society for 
                everyone.
